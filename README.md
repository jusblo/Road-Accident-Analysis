# Road-Accident-Analysis Using Excel
This project explores a road accidents dataset (2021 - 2022) to uncover insights into the factors that influence accident severity and frequency. The analysis covers data cleaning, descriptive statistics, pivot table analysis, and visualization.

‚≠ê Situation:
Road accidents remain a critical public safety concern worldwide, with multiple factors such as weather conditions, road surface conditions, speed limits, and traffic controls influencing accident severity. However, raw accident data often exists in unstructured formats, making it difficult for stakeholders to derive actionable insights.

üéØ Task:
As a Data Scientist, I was tasked with performing statistical analysis and dashboard creation to better understand accident patterns. The objective was to clean and standardize the dataset, identify high-risk factors, evaluate accident severity, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve road safety policies and resource allocation.

‚öôÔ∏è Action:

Cleaned and standardized the dataset by handling missing, inconsistent, and duplicate values.

Conducted frequency and severity analysis using pivot tables, descriptive statistics, and visualizations.

Evaluated the impact of speed limits, road conditions, weather, time of day, and light conditions on accident severity.

Built an interactive Excel dashboard to visualize accident trends and patterns, with filters and dynamic views.

Developed data-driven recommendations addressing driver behavior, infrastructure improvements, and policy measures.

üèÜ Result:

Generated actionable insights showing that most accidents occurred on dry roads and during daylight, highlighting driver behavior and traffic management as critical focus areas.

Identified that 30 mph zones had disproportionately higher fatal accidents, while dry roads and daylight increased the risk of severe crashes.

Produced clear visualizations and recommendations that can help policymakers, transport authorities, and safety organizations optimize road safety interventions and resource allocation.
